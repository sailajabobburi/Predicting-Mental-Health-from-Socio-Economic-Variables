# Ghana Panel Survey: Benchmarking and Model Interpretability for Mental Health Analysis

This project utilizes the **Ghana Panel Survey** dataset to benchmark multiple **machine learning models** and apply **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for model interpretability. The primary goal is to **identify the most influential socio-economic variables impacting mental health** by analyzing feature importance rather than solely focusing on classification accuracy.

## Project Overview

- **Benchmarking Machine Learning Models**: Evaluate **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost** to determine the most effective model for predicting mental health distress.
- **Model Interpretability Using SHAP**: Utilize SHAP values to **explain feature importance**, enabling policymakers to identify key socio-economic factors affecting mental health.
- **Strategic Feature Importance Analysis**: Rank features based on SHAP values to ensure the focus is on the most significant predictors.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Leverage extensive data from **18,000 participants across 5,000 households** over multiple survey waves to assess trends in mental health distress.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Model Benchmarking**: Compare performance metrics across multiple machine learning models.
- **SHAP-Based Interpretability**: Identify and visualize key socio-economic variables influencing mental health.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Use **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** and oversampling techniques to ensure balanced model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Address gender-based missing values and create generalized features to improve model robustness.

## Dataset
**Input Variables**
The Ghana Panel Survey includes a variety of socio-economic and demographic variables that serve as inputs for our predictive models. 
Output Variable: Kessler Dummy 1,2,3,4(collected in 4 waves)
The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) is a widely used measure of mental health distress. It is a 10-question survey that measures psychological distress, with scores ranging from 10 to 50, where higher scores indicate greater distress. In this project, we use the Kessler dummy variable as our target variable for classification and feature importance analysis.

## Installation

### **1. Clone the Repository**



### **2. Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Ensure that the `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary libraries, such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `shap`, `matplotlib`, and `imbalanced-learn`.*

## Usage

### **Run the Model Benchmarking and SHAP Analysis**

```bash
python main.py
```

### **View Results**

- Model performance metrics and SHAP visualizations will be saved in the `results/` directory.
- SHAP plots will be generated to highlight the most influential features.

## Model Evaluation and Benchmarking

- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
- **Best Model**: Random Forest achieves the highest test accuracy across all Kessler variables.
- **Feature Importance Ranking**: SHAP values are used to rank key socio-economic factors.


## SHAP-Based Feature Importance Analysis

- **Top Features Identified Using SHAP**:
  - **Age (age_yrs1)**
  - **Educational Attainment (educ1)**
  - **Employment Status of Mother (work_mother1)**
  - **Wealth (wealth1), Borrowing (borrow_yn1), Savings (savings_yn1)**
  - **Personality Traits (big5consc_score1, big5agreeable_score1)**
  - **Community Alertness (alert_community1)**
  - **Living in Shared Housing (shared_dwelling1)**

## Future Scope

- **Impact Analysis**: Quantify the direction and magnitude of each socio-economic variableâ€™s impact on mental health.
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Track individual mental health changes over time using socio-economic indicators.
- **Policy Recommendations**: Use insights to inform mental health interventions in Ghana.
